# Compiled application files for Elite over Econet on the Acorn Archimedes

This folder contains the final application files for Elite over Econet on the Acorn Archimedes, as produced by the build process.

Note that the final build does not contain the `!EliteNet.!RunImage` or `!EliteNet.WimpLib` BASIC programs, as the sources are text files and need to be converted into tokenised BBC BASIC. The MakeBasic folder produced by the build process contains a script that can be run on an Archimedes to produce the final pieces of the puzzle. MakeBasic also contains the BASIC source for the EliteScoreboard module, so that can be built on an Archimedes if required.
