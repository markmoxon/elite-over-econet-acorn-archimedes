# Compiled game discs for Elite over Econet on the Acorn Archimedes

This folder contains the final disc files for Elite over Econet on the Acorn Archimedes, as produced by the build process.

The final build does not contain the !EliteNet.!RunImage BASIC program, as this needs to be tokenised. The MakeBasic folder contains a script that can be run on an Archimedes to produce the final piece of the puzzle. MakeBasic also contains the BASIC source for the EliteNet module, so that can also be built on an Archimedes if required.
